# CS178 Project 1: Full-Stack Web Application

## Overview

This project replaces an in-class exam and reinforces the skills we've covered in the first part of the course. You will build a self-contained web application using Flask that connects to both a relational (SQL via AWS RDS) and a non-relational (NoSQL via AWS DynamoDB) database.

### Your project must:
- âœ… Be built and run locally using Visual Studio Code  
- âœ… Be deployed via Flask as a web application  
- âœ… Use both an RDS (MySQL) and DynamoDB database with a consistent theme  
- âœ… Be version-controlled using GitHub  
- âœ… Be accessible entirely through a browser interface (no terminal interaction)

## ðŸ”— What to Submit

### âœ… GitHub Repository  
[GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/grmcgr/CS178_Project1)

### âœ… Project Report  
- Screenshots of your working project  
    - `Project 1 Demo.mp4`  
- Description of how SQL and DynamoDB are integrated  
- Any challenges you encountered

### ðŸ§® Rubric

#### Part 1: Core Functionality

| Points Earned | Points Available | Criteria |
|---------------|------------------|----------|
| 10 | 10 | Website uses Flask and runs independently from VS Code |
| 15 | 15 | Relational database (MySQL/RDS) is correctly used in the project |
| 10 | 10 | Non-relational database (DynamoDB) is correctly used (e.g., user info stored/retrieved) |
| 10 | 10 | Implements full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) |
| 5  | 5  | Incorporates at least one SQL JOIN query |
| 0  | 5  | Uses own RDS instance inside studentâ€™s VPC |
| 5  | 5  | Uses own IAM account (e.g., ProjectOneUser) |
| 5  | 5  | Application avoids storing credentials in public GitHub (e.g., `creds.py` is excluded via `.gitignore`) |

#### Part 2: Code Quality and GitHub Submission

| Points Earned | Points Available | Criteria |
|---------------|------------------|----------|
| 10 | 10 | Code is organized across multiple files (e.g., `flaskapp.py`, `dbCode.py`) |
